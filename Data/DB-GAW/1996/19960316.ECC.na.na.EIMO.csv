* Pem-Tropics
* Latitude of Sonde Launch Station:  -27.17 South
* Longitude of Sonde Launch Station: -109.42 West
* Altitude of Sonde Launch Station: 69.2 Meters
* The integrated column ozone and ozone mixing ratio
* were calculated by NASA as data was not provided
* by Easter Island.  All sonde levels are reported.
