* GTE (Global Tropospheric Experiment) is a project of NASA Langley Research
* Center (NASA-LaRC).  Ozonesonde launches are one component of the data
* collected in support of this mission.

* GTE Station: Easter Island, Chile

* Crespo, Juan,Chile
* Ozone/Ecc sonde
* Pem-Tropics
* Latitude of Sonde Launch Station:  -27.17 South
* Longitude of Sonde Launch Station: -109.42 West
* Altitude of Sonde Launch Station: 69.2 Meters
* The geometric altitude, integrated column ozone
* and ozone mixing ratio were calculated by NASA
* as data was not provided by Easter.  All sonde
* levels are reported.
